## Welcome to my GAN projects. 
Currently working on creating a simple GAN capable of producting images from MNIST dataset  
Code was developed on Spyder and split on blocks, may look weird on other editors

**Most updated project**: pytorch_gan.py  
GAN.ipynb is used mostly for experimenting

In the future I will provide checkpoints for my models
