## Welcome to my GAN projects. 
Currently working on creating a simple GAN capable of producting images from MNIST dataset  
Code was developed on Spyder and split on blocks, may look weird on other editors

**Most updated project**: pytorch_gan.py  
GAN.ipynb is used mostly for experimenting

## Projects info:

1. **GAN.ipynb** - Used for experimenting
2. **pytorch_gan.py** - Working code, many  functions, needs some refactoring and cleaning
3. **gan_pytorch.pth.tar** - Checkpoint file for pretrained Generator and Discriminator 

## 1 and 2 files are based on the following architecture:
